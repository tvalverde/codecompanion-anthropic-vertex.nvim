*codecompanion-anthropic-vertex.txt* Vertex AI Adapter for CodeCompanion

==============================================================================
1. Introduction                         *codecompanion-anthropic-vertex*

codecompanion-anthropic-vertex is a dedicated adapter extension for Google 
Cloud Vertex AI, designed to integrate seamlessly with codecompanion.nvim.

It safely bridges Anthropic capabilities (Prompt Caching, Extended Thinking)
to Vertex AI's strict API requirements.

This plugin was entirely built with AI, and owes its existence to the 
incredible architecture of codecompanion.nvim created by olimorris.
